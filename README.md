# SimonGame

Simon Game is similar to the popular "Simon Says" memory game in which the players have to repeat whatever Simon says. In this interactive Simon Game, the user has to repeat a series of colour tones and lights. If the user succeeds, the levels become longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

It uses HTML and CSS in conjunction with JavaScript. In addition, jQuery is utilized to interactively change the environment using Event Listeners and more.

## Getting Started

Simply press any key on the keyboard in order to start the game. The game will show a sequence which the user has to repeat. Once a level is completed, an additional sequence will be added on top of the previous. The patterns continue to become larger as the levels progress. Once the user fails by missing any series of the pattern, the game concludes. Any key can be pressed in order to play again.
